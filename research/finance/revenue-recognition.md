# Revenue Recognition: Percentage of Completion Method\n\n**Research Date:** February 2026  \n**Prepared for:** JCW Construction\n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThe percentage of completion method is the primary revenue recognition approach for construction companies with long-term contracts. Under this method, revenue is recognized proportionally as work progresses, rather than waiting until project completion. This approach provides a more accurate picture of financial performance throughout a project lifecycle and is required by GAAP (ASC 606-10-25) for construction contracts that meet specific criteria.\n\n---\n\n## How Construction Companies Recognize Revenue by Phase\n\n### Contract Phases and Revenue Recognition\n\nConstruction projects typically progress through distinct phases, each with specific revenue recognition considerations:\n\n1. **Bidding/Pre-Construction Phase**\n   - No revenue recognized\n   - Costs may be deferred if contract is awarded\n   - Setup and mobilization costs capitalized\n\n2. **Mobilization Phase**\n   - Revenue recognized based on percentage complete\n   - Mobilization costs typically capitalized and amortized\n   - Often billed as separate line item or included in progress billing\n\n3. **Construction/Production Phase**\n   - Primary revenue recognition period\n   - Revenue recognized proportionally to costs incurred\n   - Monthly progress billings typically match revenue\n\n4. **Punch List/Completion Phase**\n   - Retainage held until completion\n   - Revenue for completed work recognized\n   - Final billing submitted\n\n5. **Closeout Phase**\n   - Release of retainage\n   - Change order finalization\n   - Final revenue adjustment\n\n### Recognition Triggers\n\nRevenue is recognized when:\n- Contract is enforceable\n- Performance obligations are identified\n- Transaction price is determinable\n- Progress toward completion is measurable\n\n---\n\n## Percentage of Completion Formula\n\n### Primary Method: Cost-to-Cost Approach\n\nThe most common method uses costs incurred as the measure of progress:\n\nPercentage Complete = (Total Costs Incurred to Date) / (Estimated Total Costs)\n\nRevenue to Recognize = Total Contract Price x Percentage Complete\n\n### Alternative Methods\n\n1. **Efforts Expended (Labor Hours)**\n   % Complete = (Labor Hours to Date) / (Estimated Total Labor Hours)\n\n2. **Units of Delivery**\n   % Complete = (Units Completed to Date) / (Total Units)\n   - Best for repetitive units (e.g. apartment buildings)\n\n3. **Survey Method**\n   - Expert assessment of physical completion\n   - Used when costs do not correlate with progress\n\n### Calculating Revenue at Period End\n\n**Step 1:** Determine Total Estimated Costs - Budgeted labor, materials, equipment, subcontracts, indirect costs\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate Percentage Complete - Current period costs / Total estimated costs\n\n**Step 3:** Compute Revenue to Date - Contract price times % complete\n\n**Step 4:** Recognize Current Period Revenue\nCurrent Period Revenue = Revenue to Date - Previously Recognized Revenue\n\n---\n\n## Implications for JCW Billing\n\n### Current JCW Timekeeper Integration\n\nJCW Labor Timekeeper already tracks:\n- Employee time by customer/project\n- Billable rates (internal and client-facing)\n- Rate overrides per customer/employee\n- Weekly labor totals\n\n### Mapping to Percentage of Completion\n\nTo implement percentage of completion, JCW should consider:\n\n1. **Job Cost Tracking**\n   - Total estimated job cost (labor + materials + equipment)\n   - Current costs incurred\n   - Compare against contract price\n\n2. **Progress Measurement**\n   - Use Labor Timekeeper hours as primary metric\n   - Map hours to job phases\n   - Track non-labor costs separately\n\n3. **Billing Alignment**\n   - Progress billings should approximate recognized revenue\n   - Retainage tracking (typically 5-10% held until completion)\n   - Change order documentation\n\n4. **Revenue vs. Billing Reconciliation**\n   Recognized Revenue = Contract Price times (Labor Complete %)\n   Billed Amount = (Labor Hours times Rate) + Materials + Equipment\n   Difference = Deferred Revenue or Unbilled Revenue\n\n### Key Considerations\n\n- **Unbilled Revenue:** Revenue recognized but not yet billed\n- **Billings in Excess of Costs:** Liability (deferred revenue) on balance sheet\n- **Costs in Excess of Billings:** Asset (unbilled receivable) when recoverable\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations\n\n### Immediate Actions\n\n1. **Implement Job Cost Categories**\n   - Add cost type tracking to Labor Timekeeper (labor, materials, equipment)\n   - Create project budget fields in the system\n\n2. **Establish Progress Metrics**\n   - Define how percentage complete will be measured\n   - Default to cost-to-cost or labor-hours method\n\n3. **Add Contract Price Field**\n   - Track original contract value per customer/project\n   - Enable change order tracking\n\n### Medium-Term Improvements\n\n4. **Integrate with Accounting**\n   - Sync recognized revenue with QuickBooks\n   - Automate journal entries for revenue recognition\n\n5. **Reporting Dashboard**\n   - Revenue by project/month\n   - Percentage complete trends\n   - Billings vs. recognized revenue variance\n\n6. **Retainage Tracking**\n   - Explicit retainage tracking by project\n   - Release schedule documentation\n\n### Best Practices\n\n- **Monthly Reconciliation:** Compare costs incurred to billings each month\n- **Estimate Reviews:** Update total cost estimates quarterly\n- **Change Order Management:** Document all scope changes with cost impact\n- **Consistency:** Use same recognition method across similar projects\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- ASC 606-10-25: Revenue Recognition from Contracts with Customers\n- AICPA Construction Contractor Audit Guide\n- GAAP Construction Contract Accounting (Percentage of Completion)\n- IRS Publication 538: Accounting Methods and Periods\n\n---\n\n*This research supports JCW Construction financial management and billing system development.*
