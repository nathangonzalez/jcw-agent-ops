# Research Process

## Cadence
- Daily scan: quick intake of new items (papers, podcasts, videos, posts).
- Weekly digest: summarize top findings and propose 1 to 3 spikes.
- Monthly review: prune backlog, select experiments, update priorities.

## Output Artifacts
- research/RESEARCH_BACKLOG.md for the queue
- research/SPIKE_TEMPLATE.md for structured spikes
- research/digests/YYYY-MM-DD.md for weekly summaries

## Quality Bar
- Prefer primary sources (papers, official docs, author talks).
- Separate evidence from opinion.
- Always include date, author, and link metadata in spikes.
