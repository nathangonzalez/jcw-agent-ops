# Persistent Memory Log

### Supervisor Memory
# Supervisor Memory (JCW Agent Ops)
## Purpose
This file captures stable context and decisions so the Codex supervisor can
operate from Slack with continuity. Keep it concise and update when major
decisions change.
## System Topology
- Slack bot (Clawbot) runs on a GCP VM for 24/7 uptime.
- Repo: `jcw-agent-ops` (GitHub). VM clones to `/opt/agent-ops`.
- VM instance: `clawbot-ops` in `us-central1-a`.
- Service account: `clawbot-sa@jcw-2-android-estimator.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
  with Secret Manager + Logging.
- Secrets stored in GCP Secret Manager:
  - `slack_bot_token`, `slack_app_token`, `slack_signing_secret`
  - `anthropic_api_key`, `openai_api_key`
- Runtime env on VM: `/etc/clawbot.env`
- Services:
  - `clawbot.service` (Slack bot)
  - `clawbot-monitor.timer` (hourly health report)
## Operating Model
- Codex (supervisor) in this chat or via Slack using prefix `codex:`.

### Supervisor Backlog
# Supervisor Backlog
## P0 - Must Fix
- Ensure Slack responses are context-rich (match this chat).
- Confirm sprint board parsing in Slack always works (CRLF-safe).
## P1 - High Priority
- Add `SUPERVISOR_BACKLOG` and `SUPERVISOR_MEMORY` readback in Slack:
  `/claw codex supervisor status`.
- Add optional "Codex default" toggle (no prefix) via env.
- Add daily summary job (sprint + digest) to `#jcw_bot`.
- Payroll: reconcile weekly exports vs SQLite DB.
- Suite: build modern dashboard with backlog cards + suite scaffold.
## P2 - Enhancements
- Create a persistent memory file (`PERSIST.txt`) and a summary updater.
- Add explicit status commands:
  - `/claw status` (sprint summary)
  - `/claw digest` (latest digest)
  - `/claw agent-status` (bot uptime + errors)

### Sprint Board (top)
# Sprint Board
**Lane Summaries (2026-02-18)**
- Infra Lane: Monorepo CI/CD plan with path filters, matrix builds, patch deploy, and manual promote for App Engine services.
- Product Lane: Suite-shell UX with top bar + side app dock, app routing, and lazy module loading.
- Finance Lane: Ledger taxonomy v1, manual review triggers, and cash flow phase mapping by construction phase.
- Scout Lane: Repo inventory template; only payroll partially filled; needs crawl of all JCW repos.
- Research Lane: 5 agentic modeling spikes; sources require verification before adoption.
---
**Ready**
- Infra: Draft monorepo directory layout under `services/` with payroll, estimating, financials, suite-shell. Acceptance: repo layout doc + directories created.
- Product: Build suite-shell skeleton UI with app buttons and routing stub. Acceptance: app dock renders and routes to placeholder pages.
- Research: Verify sources and convert 5 spikes into full spike docs with evidence. Acceptance: 5 spike files in `research/spikes/`.
**In Progress**
- Infra: Implement GitHub Actions matrix workflow with path filters and App Engine patch/promote per service. Acceptance: `infra/ci-cd-monorepo.yml` added.
- Scout: Create repo inventory and populate all JCW repos. Acceptance: table with stack, deploy, datastore, owners, risks.
**Blocked**
- None
**Done**
- Finance: Ledger taxonomy v1 published (`finance/ledger_taxonomy_v1.md`).
- Finance: Manual review queue spec published (`finance/manual_review_queue.md`).
- Finance: Cash flow phase mapping published (`finance/cash_flow_phase_mapping.md`).
- Infra: Monorepo plan drafted (`infra/monorepo_plan.md`).
- Product: Suite-shell UX spec drafted (`product/suite_shell_spec.md`).
- Scout: Initial repo inventory drafted (`inventory/repo_inventory.md`).
