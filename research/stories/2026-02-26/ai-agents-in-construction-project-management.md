However, adoption barriers persist, including data integration challenges, workforce adaptation requirements, and regulatory compliance concerns.

## Background & Context

### Industry Landscape

The global construction industry, valued at $12.7 trillion in 2024, faces endemic productivity challenges. According to McKinsey Global Institute, construction productivity has grown at only 1% annually over the past two decades, significantly lagging behind manufacturing (3.6%) and the overall economy (2.8%).

Traditional project management approaches rely heavily on manual processes, fragmented communication systems, and reactive decision-making. The Construction Industry Institute reports that poor project management practices contribute to:
- 27% average cost overrun across all project types
- 35% schedule delays in complex infrastructure projects  
- 8-12% material waste due to coordination failures
- 15-20% productivity loss from information delays

### AI Agent Technology Evolution

AI agents represent autonomous software entities capable of perceiving their environment, making decisions, and executing actions to achieve specific objectives. In construction project management, these agents operate within multi-agent systems (MAS) frameworks, enabling distributed problem-solving across complex project networks.
