# Evidence Grader

## Overview
Score sources on reliability and relevance, then summarize risks and recommended use. Use this before citing sources in decisions or research digests.

## Workflow
1. Identify source type and author or organization.
2. Score reliability and relevance using the rubric in `references/quality_rubric.md`.
3. Flag conflicts, gaps, or single-source claims.
4. Recommend whether to use, verify, or discard the source.

## Output Requirements
- Provide a table with: Source, Type, Reliability (1-5), Relevance (1-5), Risks, Recommendation.
- Note any conflicts across sources.

## Resources
- `references/quality_rubric.md`
