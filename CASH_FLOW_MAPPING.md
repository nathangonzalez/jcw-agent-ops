# Cash-Flow Phase Mapping

## Assumptions
- Project funded via milestone-based draws (owner or lender).
- Standard residential or light commercial schedule; adjust for fast track.
- Subcontractors paid per progress; retainage held until closeout.
- Material and labor rates per bid; change orders may shift flow.
- Contingency reserve held for unforeseen costs.

## Data Gaps
- Exact draw schedule (timing and percent per phase)
- Subcontractor payment terms and retainage
- Owner pay terms (processing lag)
- Known change orders or procurement risks

## Phase Map

### Preconstruction (Precon)
- Inflows: precon fee or retainer; design or permitting advance if structured
- Outflows: architect or engineer fees, permit applications, legal or insurance setup, surveys, geotech, estimating
- Variance checks: soft costs vs estimate; permit delays
- Reserve notes: buffer for redesigns or entitlement delays

### Foundation
- Inflows: foundation milestone draw; possible mobilization advance
- Outflows: grading and site prep, excavation, formwork, concrete, rebar, foundation subs, equipment rental
- Variance checks: soil or weather impacts; inspection timing
- Reserve notes: unexpected site conditions

### Framing
- Inflows: framing start or completion draw; possible staged payments
- Outflows: lumber or steel, sheathing, truss package, crane or equipment, framing labor
- Variance checks: material waste, delivery delays, scope creep
- Reserve notes: material price volatility

### Windows and Enclosure
- Inflows: dried-in or weather-tight milestone draw; payment at windows and doors install
- Outflows: window and door deposits, glazing or carpentry labor, flashing and weatherproofing materials
- Variance checks: supplier lead times; weather delays
- Reserve notes: material shortages or water intrusion fixes

### MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing)
- Inflows: rough-in milestone draw; possibly separate trade draws
- Outflows: MEP sub advances, ductwork, wiring, piping, panels, fixtures, inspection costs
- Variance checks: allowances vs actuals; trade coordination delays
- Reserve notes: code compliance remedies

### Drywall
- Inflows: drywall milestone draw; staged payments for delivery, install, tape or sand
- Outflows: drywall materials, drywall labor, disposal or waste hauling
- Variance checks: scrap rates; scope changes after rough-in
- Reserve notes: patch or rework buffer

### Finishes
- Inflows: progress draws for interior finish milestones; final payment at substantial completion
- Outflows: paint, flooring, cabinetry, millwork, tile, fixtures, finish labor, final cleaning
- Variance checks: selections vs allowance; client changes
- Reserve notes: punch list contingency

### Closeout
- Inflows: final draw or retainage release
- Outflows: final vendor payments, warranty items, turnover costs
- Variance checks: final vs forecasted total spend; lien releases
- Reserve notes: latent defect claims

## Variance Checks
- Compare actuals vs estimate by phase.
- Flag more than 10 percent overrun or more than 15 percent underrun.
- Track material vs labor splits.

## Reserve Planning
- Suggested reserve: 5 to 10 percent of contract value.
- Increase to 12 to 15 percent for high-risk phases (foundation, MEP).

## Key Insights
- Outflows often lead inflows due to deposits and procurement lead times.
- Subcontractor schedules rarely align perfectly with owner draw cycles.
- Retainage delays full payment until closeout.
