## Papers

### 1. "A Survey of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning"  
**Authors:** Yongyu Wang, Zongqing Lu  
**Date:** 2021  
**Summary:**  
This survey comprehensively reviews recent advancements in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), including topics such as credit assignment, communication, coordination, and scalability. It categorizes approaches by learning paradigm and addresses the core challenges in applying reinforcement learning to distributed agent settings.  
**Why it matters:**  
MARL is foundational for practical deployment of agentic and multi-agent systems. This paper provides both a landscape view for newcomers and a roadmap for tackling current limitations in coordination and scalability.

### 2. "Agentic Alignment: Foundations and Open Problems"  
**Authors:** Paul Christiano  
**Date:** 2023  
**Summary:**  
Paul Christiano details conceptual frameworks for aligning advanced agentic systems with human values, focusing on the potential for agents to develop subgoals and the risks of delegation and autonomy. The paper lays out open technical problems for safely training and deploying agentic AI.  
**Why it matters:**  
Agentic alignment is central to ensuring multi-agent systems act safely and predictably, especially as they become more autonomous and impactful.

### 3. "Learning to Communicate with Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning"  
**Authors:** Jakob N. Foerster et al.  
**Date:** 2016  
**Summary:**  
The authors demonstrate that multi-agent systems can evolve effective communication protocols using deep RL, improving performance on cooperative tasks. Notably, the paper explores differentiable communication channels and end-to-end learning of message passing.  
**Why it matters:**  
Enabling agents to autonomously develop communication strategies is vital for the scalability and flexibility of multi-agent systems.
