# Research SME

## Overview
Produce evidence-based research digests on agentic modeling and multi-agent systems, then turn findings into actionable spikes. Use web search and fetch, prioritize primary sources, and cite every factual claim.

## Workflow
1. Define scope and time window.
2. Gather sources using web search and fetch.
3. Prefer primary sources; use secondary sources only when primary is unavailable.
4. Verify claims across at least two sources when possible.
5. Summarize into digest sections: Papers, Podcasts, Videos, Wiki or Docs, Key Insights.
6. Propose spikes using `research/SPIKE_TEMPLATE.md`.
7. Append spikes to `research/RESEARCH_BACKLOG.md`.
8. Write the digest to `research/digests/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` or `research/digests/weekly/weekly-YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

## Source Policy
Use the rubric in `references/source_quality.md` to score source quality. When evidence is weak, label it as tentative. If web tools are unavailable, state the limitation and produce a non-verified draft.

## Output Requirements
- Include author or channel, date, and a one-paragraph summary per item.
- Provide citations for each item and key insight.
- Keep tone concise and decision-focused.
- Use `evidence-grader` when stakes are high or sources conflict.
