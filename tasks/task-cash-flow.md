# Task: Cash-Flow Phase Mapping (Agent: research)

## Goal
Draft phase-to-cash-flow mapping and variance logic.

## Scope
- Phase inflow/outflow patterns
- Triggers by construction milestone
- Variance and reserve notes

## Inputs
- DATA_MODEL.md
- Any schedule/milestone data (pending)

## Outputs
- CASH_FLOW_MAPPING.md

## Acceptance Criteria
- Phase map covers standard construction phases
- Includes assumptions and data gaps
- Notes on reserve planning

## Risk
Low (documentation only)

## Status
Assigned
