## Current Focus (SuperNova2)
- Ledger taxonomy and review workflow
- Cash flow phase mapping

## Payroll App Improvements (Candidate)
- End-to-end data validation to prevent entry errors and ensure consistency.
- Immutable, timestamped logs for all payroll actions and changes.
- Advanced, filterable audit and compliance reports with export options.
- Built-in anomaly detection to catch outliers and potential fraud.
- Role-based access control with full visibility into access and changes.
