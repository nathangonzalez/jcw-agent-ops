# Scope Gap Analysis - Preventing Missed Scope in Construction Bids

**Research Date:** February 2026
**Prepared for:** JCW Construction
**Category:** Estimating Best Practices

---

## Executive Summary

Scope gaps represent one of the most significant profit erosion factors in construction. This research examines common scope gaps, checklist methodologies, software tools, and JCW-specific recommendations.

---

## 1. Common Scope Gaps in Construction

### 1.1 M Exclusions (Missing Items)

| Category | Common M Exclusions | Impact |
|----------|---------------------|--------|
| Site Work | Tree removal, erosion control, final grading | 2-5% of bid |
| Foundations | Special inspections, geotechnical fees | 1-3% of bid |
| Structural | Moment connections, drift clips, bridging | 2-4% of bid |
| MEP | Testing/balancing, commissioning, permits | 3-8% of bid |
| Finishes | Mockups, transition strips, accessories | 1-2% of bid |
| General Conditions | Final cleaning, punch list repairs, utilities | 2-4% of bid |

### Common M Exclusion Patterns

1. Design Development Gaps: Specs change between conceptual and construction docs
2. Code Compliance: Items required by code but not shown on drawings
3. Trade Coordination: Items between scope lines
4. Allowance Misunderstanding: Allowances quoted as lump sum vs actual cost
5. Permit and Fee Oversight: Building permits, impact fees, tap fees
6. Temporary Facilities: Site offices, temporary power/water, fencing
7. Closeout Requirements: As-built drawings, O&M manuals, training


### 1.2 Allowances vs. Line Items

Allowances create significant scope gap risk:

| Allowance Type | Risk Level | Common Issues |
|----------------|------------|---------------|
| Lump Sum Allowance | High | Often under-quoted |
| Unit Price Allowance | Medium | Unit prices may not match actual market |
| Owner-Controlled Allowance | Low-Medium | Scope unclear; change orders likely |
| Design Allowances | High | Engineering not complete at bid time |

### Allowance Best Practices

1. Define Scope Precisely
2. Include Contingency: Add 10-20% buffer
3. Track Actuals: Maintain allowance vs actual cost tracking
4. Require Detail: Request itemized breakdown
5. Set Trigger Points: Define when allowance converts to line item

### 1.3 Other Common Scope Gaps

- Design-Build Handoff: Info gaps between design and construction
- Specification Conflicts: Drawings and specs contradict each other
- Addendum Impact: Addendum items not fully priced
- Existing Conditions: Hidden conditions discovered during construction
- Insurance/Bonds: OCIP/CCIP exclusions, waiver of subrogation
- Sustainability: LEED documentation, commissioning, metering
