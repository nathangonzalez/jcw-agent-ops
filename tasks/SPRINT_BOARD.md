- Product Lane: Suite-shell UX with top bar + side app dock, app routing, and lazy module loading.
- Finance Lane: Ledger taxonomy v1, manual review triggers, and cash flow phase mapping by construction phase.
- Scout Lane: Repo inventory template; only payroll partially filled; needs crawl of all JCW repos.
