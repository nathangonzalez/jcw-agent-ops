# 2026-02-20

- User approved 24/7 CI/CD and ABC tracks (reconciliation, suite shell store, approvals).
- Added approval queue seed file (tasks/approval_queue.json) with exec-based reconcile task.
- Implemented queue + exec-on-approve flow in slack_bot.py (queue polling, status updates, exec handling).
- Added payroll prod reconcile scripts: run_reconcile_prod.sh + payroll_db_summary.py.
- Added suite app registry data/suite_apps.json and /api/apps endpoint + UI updates (suite store grid).
- Added hourly schedule-based patch deploy for jcw_payroll CI/CD (ci-cd.yml schedule + gate + deploy-patch-schedule).- Attempted prod reconcile on VM; gsutil failed with 403 (clawbot-sa missing storage.objects.list). Need bucket access for gs://jcw-labor-timekeeper.
