## Papers

### 1. "Cooperative Emergence in Large Language Model Multi-Agent Simulations"
**Authors:** Mingyu Chen, Sara Li, et al.  
**Date:** 2026-02-14 (arXiv preprint)  
**Summary:**  
This paper presents experiments using GPT-4-style agents in a shared simulated world requiring agents to cooperate on resource tasks. Results show spontaneous coalitions, negotiation, and group coordination strategies without hand-designed protocols. The authors analyze under which environmental parameters agentic cooperation is most robust and when it breaks down.  
**Why it matters:**  
Demonstrates the rapid progress in large language models exhibiting emergent social dynamics—key for scaling multi-agent deployments and studying complex collective behavior.

## Key Insights

- Spontaneous collaboration and group behavior are emerging even in generic LLM-based agent populations—a sign of rapidly increasing agent sophistication.
- Safety and alignment remain central concerns, especially as agent collectives become capable of complex, unanticipated interactions.
- Public benchmarks and open APIs (OMASI, DeepMind) are helping unify the research ecosystem and accelerate shared progress.

## Proposed Spikes

### 1. Spike: Benchmarking Collaboration Modes in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Simulations
- **Goal:** Compare negotiation/cooperation success rates under different environment parameters for simulated LLM agents.
- **Scope:** Reproduce key tasks from Chen et al. (2026-02-14), running agents with and without explicit communication channels.
- **Sources:**  
  - Chen et al., 2026-02-14 (arXiv)  
  - DeepMind tool-use video & benchmarks (2026-02-12)
- **Experiment:**  
  1. Simulate resource-sharing environments.
  2. Log coalition formation, negotiation outcomes, and task efficiency.
  3. Analyze for parameter regimes leading to spontaneous cooperation vs. collapse.
