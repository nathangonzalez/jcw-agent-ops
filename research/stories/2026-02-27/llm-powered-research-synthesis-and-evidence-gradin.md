## Background & Context

### Current State of Construction Research
The construction industry generates approximately 2,500+ peer-reviewed papers annually across major journals (Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, Automation in Construction, Construction Management and Economics). However, practitioners report that only 15-20% of relevant research reaches field application within 5 years of publication, creating a significant innovation gap.

### Traditional Research Synthesis Challenges
1. **Volume Overload**: Construction professionals spend an average of 3-4 hours per week searching for technical information (Construction Industry Institute, 2023)
2. **Quality Assessment**: Manual evidence grading requires 8-12 hours per comprehensive literature review
3. **Cross-Domain Integration**: Siloed research across structural engineering, materials science, project management, and digital technologies

### Emergence of LLM Solutions
Recent advances in domain-specific LLMs, particularly those trained on construction datasets, have demonstrated capabilities in:
- Automated abstract screening with 89% accuracy (MIT Construction Research Center, 2024)
- Technical document summarization with domain-specific terminology retention
- Evidence quality assessment using standardized frameworks (GRADE, CONSORT)
