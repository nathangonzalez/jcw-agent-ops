# Spike Generator

## Overview
Turn research findings into short, testable spikes that can be scheduled and validated quickly. Use the repo spike template and update the research backlog.

## Workflow
1. Identify 3 to 5 promising findings or gaps.
2. Convert each into a spike with a clear goal and scope.
3. Include sources, a minimal experiment plan, and success criteria.
4. Append spikes to `research/RESEARCH_BACKLOG.md`.

## Output Requirements
- Use the structure in `research/SPIKE_TEMPLATE.md`.
- Keep each spike under one page.
- Prefer experiments that can run in 1 to 2 days.

## Resources
- `research/SPIKE_TEMPLATE.md`
- `research/RESEARCH_BACKLOG.md`
