# Labor Burden Rates in Construction

## Executive Summary

Labor burden rates represent the hidden costs beyond base wages that significantly impact construction project profitability. For JCW Construction, accurately calculating labor burden rates (typically ranging from 25-40 percent of base wages) is essential for competitive yet profitable bidding.

## Key Findings

### What is Labor Burden?
Labor burden is the total cost of employing a worker beyond their base hourly wage or salary. It includes:

- **Payroll Taxes**: Social Security (6.2 percent), Medicare (1.45 percent), FUTA (0.6 percent), state unemployment
- **Workers Compensation**: Industry-specific rates, typically 5-15 percent for construction
- **General Liability Insurance**: Usually 2-5 percent of payroll
- **Health Insurance**: Average 6,500-12,000 USD per year per employee
- **Retirement Benefits**: 401(k) matches typically 3-6 percent of wages
- **Paid Time Off**: Vacation, holidays, sick leave (typically 5-10 percent of wages)
- **Training and Safety**: OSHA requirements, certifications, ongoing education

### Industry Benchmarks

- **General Construction**: 25-35 percent burden rate
- **Specialty Trades (Electrical, Plumbing, HVAC)**: 30-40 percent burden rate
- **Heavy Civil/Highway**: 28-38 percent burden rate
- **Residential**: 20-30 percent burden rate

### Calculation Formula

Labor Burden Rate = (Total Burden Costs) / (Base Wages)
Total Hourly Cost = Base Hourly Rate x (1 + Labor Burden Rate)

## Recommendations for JCW Construction

1. Calculate accurate burden rates by trade/position rather than using a blanket rate
2. Track actual costs and maintain detailed records of all burden components
3. Always apply burden rates when estimating labor costs in bids
4. Review burden rates quarterly to account for insurance premium changes
5. Separate direct vs indirect burden costs
6. Create a standard labor burden calculation template for consistency
