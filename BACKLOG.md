## Now (Next 7 Days)
1. Monorepo plan + migration checklist — Acceptance: target repo layout, service boundaries, and migration steps documented.
2. Suite shell skeleton (single UI with app buttons) — Acceptance: routes + nav + placeholder tiles wired.
3. CI/CD multi-service template (patch + promote) — Acceptance: matrix workflow that deploys each app service independently.
4. Repo inventory matrix — Acceptance: each JCW repo mapped to stack, hosting, data store, deploy method.
5. Ledger taxonomy v1 — Acceptance: categories + subcategories cover 95% of known transactions.
6. Manual review queue spec — Acceptance: review states, decisions, and outputs documented.
7. Cash flow phase mapping draft — Acceptance: phase to cost and phase to inflow mapping documented.

## Ready Queue (Next 30 Days)
1. Rule engine wireframe — Acceptance: match types, priorities, and overrides documented.
2. Estimator vs actuals comparison spec — Acceptance: variance rules defined per phase.
3. Payroll cost allocation mapping — Acceptance: payroll to job/phase mapping documented.
4. Financials app deep dive report — Acceptance: architecture + top 5 improvements proposed.
5. Estimator app deep dive report — Acceptance: architecture + top 5 improvements proposed.
6. 3D studio deep dive report — Acceptance: pipeline map + top 5 improvements proposed.
7. Agent governance v1 — Acceptance: guardrails + approval process + logging checked in.
8. Open-source agent research backlog — Acceptance: 10 spikes with sources and evaluation criteria.

## Parallel Agent Lanes (Supervisor Queue)
1. Infra Lane — Monorepo CI/CD, App Engine service routing, deploy strategy.
2. Product Lane — Suite shell UX, app buttons, cross-app navigation model.
3. Finance Lane — Ledger taxonomy + cash flow phase mapping.
4. Scout Lane — Repo inventory + deep dive reports.
5. Research Lane — Agentic modeling papers/podcasts + spike backlog.

## Payroll App Improvements (Candidates)
1. End-to-end data validation to prevent entry errors and ensure consistency.
2. Immutable, timestamped logs for all payroll actions and changes.
3. Advanced, filterable audit and compliance reports with export options.
4. Built-in anomaly detection to catch outliers and potential fraud.
5. Role-based access control with full visibility into access and changes.
