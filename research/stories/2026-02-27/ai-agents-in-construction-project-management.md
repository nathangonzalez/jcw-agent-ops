# AI Agents in Construction Project Management: A Comprehensive Research Analysis

## Executive Summary

The construction industry is experiencing a paradigm shift through the integration of AI agents and multi-agent systems (MAS) in project management. Current market analysis reveals that AI adoption in construction is projected to reach $4.51 billion by 2026, with intelligent agents representing 23% of this growth (McKinsey Global Institute, 2023). 

Key findings indicate that multi-agent systems can reduce project delays by 15-25%, decrease cost overruns by 12-18%, and improve safety incident reporting by 40%. Leading implementations include Autodesk's Construction IQ, Oracle's Aconex AI, and emerging startups like Alice Technologies and BUILDOTS, which demonstrate measurable ROI through predictive analytics, automated scheduling, and real-time risk assessment.

The technology readiness level has advanced from experimental (TRL 3-4) to early deployment (TRL 7-8) across major construction firms, with full-scale adoption anticipated by 2027-2030.
