# Spike: Stucco Alternatives + Slurry/Bonding Options (JCW)

## Title
Stucco Alternatives for High Bid Mitigation + Slurry/Bonding Options for Tile Roofs

## Goal
Identify lower-cost, code-compliant exterior finish alternatives to traditional stucco and assess feasibility of polymer-modified slurry/bonding approaches (including tile roof slurry coating) for JCW bids.

## Scope
- In scope:
  - EIFS/direct-applied systems
  - Fiber cement cladding
  - Preblended stucco scratch/brown alternatives
  - Acrylic bonding agents and admixtures for mortar/slurry coats
  - Tile roof slurry coating background (manufacturing/maintenance context)
- Out of scope:
  - Full structural reroofing recommendations
  - Detailed cost takeoffs per vendor

## Sources
- Primary:
  - SikaLatex product info and PDS (bonding agent + mortar admixture)
  - SpecChem StuccoBond product info (bonding agent + ASTM references)
  - Dryvit / Sto EIFS system overviews
  - James Hardie fiber cement official durability overview
- Secondary:
  - Tile roof slurry coating forum threads (anecdotal)
  - Roof maintenance guide (tile slurry coat background)

## Findings
- Acrylic bonding agents are commonly used as admixtures or bonding coats to improve adhesion and durability of stucco/mortar mixes. Manufacturer ratios and substrate prep requirements vary and must be followed.
- EIFS systems provide a lightweight, insulation-forward cladding option with manufacturer-backed systems and long service life when installed correctly.
- Fiber cement siding offers a durable, non-combustible cladding option that can reduce stucco labor in some contexts.
- Preblended stucco scratch/brown mixes can reduce onsite variability and speed installation.
- Tile roof slurry coatings are a known manufacturing method; repainting or recoating exists but is highly substrate- and product-dependent; field-applied slurry coats require careful evaluation and testing.

## Implications for JCW
- Build a value-engineering path: EIFS or fiber cement as alternates when stucco bids are high, with clear client-facing tradeoffs.
- For tile roof work, treat slurry coat / bonding admixture approaches as experimental unless a manufacturer system + warranty is available.

## Proposed Experiments
1. Mock-up adhesion test using 2–3 bonding agents on representative substrates (success: bond/impact tests pass and no delamination after wet/dry cycle).
2. Vendor pricing survey for EIFS vs fiber cement vs traditional stucco on 2 pilot projects (success: alternate within target budget while meeting aesthetic and code constraints).

## Risks and Open Questions
- Warranty: most manufacturers restrict or void warranties if non-approved mixes are used.
- Code: EIFS and fiber cement assemblies require specific weather barrier and flashing details.
- Tile roof slurry coats: uncertain field performance without OEM system approval.
